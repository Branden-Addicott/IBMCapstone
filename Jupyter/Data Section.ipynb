    "The US Accident June 20  from [Kagle](https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents) data set is used for this research. It contains an accident severity indicator ranging from 1 to 4. 1 indicates the a lesser impact on traffic and 4 indicates a significant impact on traffic.  The data set contains accident data from February 2016 through June 2020 for 49 of the 50 states within the US (excluding Hawaii). It contains approximately 3.5 million (3,513,617) observations across 42 variables ([Data Dictionary](https://smoosavi.org/datasets/us_accidents)). The data was collected from three sources: Bing 29.45%, Map Quest  68.71% and Map Quest â€“ Bing 1.84%.\n",

    "To gain an understanding of this large data set, I subset the data by state to South Carolina (My current state of residence). This left me with a more manageable 173,277 observation. I also removed and altered some of the variables within the data set to better fit the business plan. I kept the Severity indicator, split the time stamp of start_time into its date, day and hour parts (start_date, start_day and start_hour). I also retained  Temperature, Visibility, Wind_Speed and Precipitation.\n",

    "I used DB2 (SQL) to subset and reduce the number of variables for this data and created a new csv file to load into python3 with Jupyter Notebooks. "
